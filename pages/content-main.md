## Easily Control Your Page Content

Using a combination of Flask, Frozen Flask, and Flask Flat Pages, and Bootstrap 5, you can quickly get your blog up and running with minimal programming experience.

With Flask, a lightweight web framework, you'll enjoy a user-friendly and intuitive experience. Its simplicity makes it ideal for beginners, allowing you to focus on building your blog's functionality without getting overwhelmed by complex syntax.

Flask Flat Pages takes it a step further by providing a simple way to manage your blog's content. You can create and edit pages using Markdown, a beginner-friendly markup language, which eliminates the need for complex HTML coding. This way, you can quickly update your blog posts and keep your content fresh.

Frozen Flask comes into play by generating static files from your Flask application. This means your blog can be served without the need for a dynamic server, making it faster and more secure. This project expands on the combination of the three parts above by separating the main page content out into it's own markdown file and using HTMx to swap it into the page when building the site. All of your content that might need to change is controlled through markdown.

Additionally, by leveraging Bootstrap, a widely-used CSS framework, you can easily ensure that your blog's styling is handled correctly. Bootstrap provides a vast array of pre-designed components and responsive layouts, empowering you to create a visually appealing blog without the need for extensive CSS knowledge.
