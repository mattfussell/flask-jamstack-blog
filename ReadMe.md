# Flask Jamstack Blog

The goal of this project is to create a JamStack site that is based on Python. I want to spend less time dealing with HTML and CSS and instead use Markdown to create the site content while automating the rest with Python. I need stronger Python chops to advance my career and I want a space to express my thoughts that I created.

### To install the requirements:

Use `pipenv shell` to launch a virtual environment, the `activate` *if necessary*. Then run the following command:

```python
pipenv install --dev
```

### To run the app:

`python server.py`
